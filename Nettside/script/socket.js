//Since Arduino has a limited amount of timers, and using millis can be annoying, we have the possibilties of handing that task over to JavaScript on Node.js

//Since the ESP32 easily can react to such a request it sends the data with no problems, and with no timers in use.
//This means we dont have to use the delay() function or the millis() function in Arduino, we can just let Node and JavaScript fix the tracking of time for us
